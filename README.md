### Description

This Python script processes `.ass` subtitle files by adding the previous and next lines of dialogue to each event for better context. It reads an input file, processes the events, and writes the updated content to an output file.

### Code Explanation

- **`read_ass_file(file_path)`**: Reads the .ass file and returns its lines.
- **`write_ass_file(file_path, lines)`**: Writes lines to the .ass file.
- **`process_events(lines)`**: Separates the header and events from the lines.
- **`add_previous_next_lines(events)`**: Adds the previous and next lines of dialogue to each event.
- **`integrate_events(header, processed_events)`**: Combines the header and processed events into the final output.
- **`display_file_contents(file_path, file_label)`**: Displays file contents for verification.
- **`main()`**: Executes the script by reading, processing, and writing the subtitle file, and then displaying the input and output contents.


The transformed output will be saved to `output.ass`.
